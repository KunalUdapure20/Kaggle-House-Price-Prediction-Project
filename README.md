### Project Overview: Kaggle House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques

#### Objective
The objective of this project is to predict house prices using the Kaggle-provided dataset. The process involves data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, model building, and evaluation to develop a robust predictive model.

#### Steps and Workflow

1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - **Loading Data**: Import the training and test datasets using Pandas.
   - **Handling Missing Values**: Identify and impute or drop missing values for features such as 'LotFrontage', 'GarageType', and 'MasVnrArea'.
   - **Data Transformation**: Encode categorical variables into numerical values using one-hot encoding for features like 'Neighborhood' and 'HouseStyle'.
   - **Normalization and Scaling**: Normalize and scale numerical features to ensure they contribute equally to the model.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - **Descriptive Statistics**: Generate summary statistics for numerical and categorical features to understand data distribution.
   - **Visualization**: Use Matplotlib and Seaborn to create visualizations like histograms, box plots, and heatmaps to explore relationships between features and the target variable, 'SalePrice'.
   - **Correlation Analysis**: Analyze feature correlations with the target variable and among features to identify highly influential predictors.

3. **Feature Engineering**
   - **Creating New Features**: Develop new features like 'TotalSF' (total square footage) and 'Age' (age of the house) to capture more information.
   - **Handling Skewed Data**: Apply transformations like log or Box-Cox to skewed features to improve model performance.
   - **Feature Selection**: Use techniques like Lasso regression and feature importance from tree-based models to select the most relevant features.

4. **Model Building**
   - **Model Selection**: Evaluate various regression models, including Linear Regression, Ridge Regression, Lasso Regression, AdaBoost, Decision Trees, Random Forest.
   - **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Use GridSearchCV and RandomizedSearchCV to optimize model parameters.
   - **Model Stacking**: Implement ensemble methods like stacking to combine the predictions of multiple models for better accuracy.

5. **Model Evaluation**
   - **Validation**: Evaluate models using cross-validation techniques and performance metrics such as RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) and RÂ² score.
   - **Final Model Selection**: Choose the best-performing model based on validation results.
   - **Test Prediction**: Apply the final model to the test dataset to generate price predictions.

6. **Submission**
   - **Preparing Submission File**: Create a CSV file with the predicted house prices for the test dataset in the required format for Kaggle submission.
   - **Kaggle Submission**: Upload the predictions to Kaggle and receive the competition score.

#### Technologies and Tools
